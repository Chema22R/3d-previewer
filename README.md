# 3D Previewer
This applications is a 3D objects previewer that allows users to interact and carry out certain basic operations on loaded objects,
enabling their analysis in detail.

The main interface (right button) allows users to send an STL, OBJ or PLY object to the server, where its geometry is extracted and
stored. In addition, users can access through the main interface (left button) a list of objects whose geometry is stored on the server,
being able to select or delete the listed objects.

In both ways, users can load an object into the interface, after which users can perform basic operations on the object, such as rotation,
padding or zooming.
